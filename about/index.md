I am a statistician currently working as an Independent Junior Research Group
Leader at the Cluster of Excellence SimTech at the University of Stuttgart
(Germany). I am the author of the R package
[brms](https://github.com/paul-buerkner/brms) and member of the
[Stan](http://mc-stan.org/) Development Team. Previously, I have studied
Psychology and Mathematics at the Universities of Münster and Hagen and did my
PhD in Münster about optimal design and Bayesian data analysis. I have also
worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Computer Science at
Aalto University (Finland). See [here](../publications) for an overview of my
scientific publications. You can also find me on
[GoogleScholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JSj6m1IAAAAJ&hl).
