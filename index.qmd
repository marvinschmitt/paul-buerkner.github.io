## What I Do

I am a statistician with a background in psychology and mathematics currently working as a Junior Research Group Leader for Bayesian Statistics at the Cluster of Excellence SimTech, University of Stuttgart. Soon, I will become Full Professor for Computational Statistics at the Department of Statistics, TU Dortmund University.

I work on a wide range of research topics most of which involve the development, evaluation, implementation, or application of Bayesian methods. To learn more about my work, check out the links at the top.
