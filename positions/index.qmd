If you are interested in joining my lab as a PhD student or
PostDoc, please [reach out to me](mailto:paul.buerkner@gmail.com) at any point;
even if there is currently no announced open position available that matches
your profile.

Currently, I have the following open positions in my lab:

- [PhD student or PostDoc position](pdf/position_bayesflow_2023.pdf) focusing on 
simulation-based Bayesian inference research in the context of our
[BayesFlow](../software#bayesflow) framework.
- [Student assistant position](student_assistant_software_engineering_ml_2023.pdf) 
focusing on software engineering of probabilistic machine learning methods.
